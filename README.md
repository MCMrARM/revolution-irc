## roboirc's discussion:

As this is forked from the original repo please note while loading into Android Studio and compiling that you should NOT update the GRADLE for this project otherwise the code will not compile. That is very important!

## roboirc's plans:

Compile in Android Studio on Linux

- Make improvements in revolution-irc as I see fit for menus etc.
